# Stores-manager
The Alpride Stores management system is designed and developed to ease inventory management in Government offices by automating the processing of receipts, issues, and timely generation of reports of stores by procurement departments in Government structured Agencies.
I have developed the system in the .NET 1.0 environment using C# window forms and Mysql.
